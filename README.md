# 📊 Military Expenditure Analysis (EDA & Strategic Insights)

A comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of global military expenditure using **SIPRI data (1949–2024)**, with a focused strategic analysis on **India’s defence posture**, threat dynamics, and budget structure.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

This project aims to:

- Analyze long-term **global military expenditure trends**
- Compare defence spending among major military powers
- Evaluate **defence burden (% of GDP)** and economic sustainability
- Assess **strategic threats to India (China vs Pakistan)**
- Analyze **India’s defence budget**, capital vs revenue split, and R&D allocation
- Examine **indigenous defence manufacturing and exports**

The project combines **data-driven EDA** with **strategic interpretation**, going beyond basic visualization.

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered

- How has global military expenditure evolved over time?
- Which countries dominate defence spending today?
- Is China or Pakistan a bigger threat to India—and why?
- How sustainable is defence spending relative to GDP?
- Is India prioritizing modernization or manpower-heavy defence?
- How strong is India’s indigenous defence manufacturing ecosystem?

## 📈 Visualizations Included

The project contains **12+ analytical visualizations**, including:

1. Global military expenditure trend (2000–2024)
2. Top global military spenders (latest year)
3. Spending comparison: USA, China, India, Russia, Pakistan
4. Defence spending growth rates
5. Defence burden (% of GDP)
6. Composite threat assessment
7. Technology capability comparison (AI, cyber, drones, space)
8. India defence budget trend
9. Capital vs Revenue expenditure
10. Defence R&D allocation
11. Indigenous procurement vs imports
12. Defence exports growth

Each chart is supported by **interpretive analysis**, not just visuals.

## ⚠️ Threat Assessment Framework

Threats were assessed using three dimensions:

- **Capability** → Military spending & technology level
- **Intent** → Historical posture & regional behavior
- **Sustainability** → GDP burden & long-term growth

### Key Insight
- **China = Long-term strategic threat** (scale + technology + endurance)
- **Pakistan = Short-term tactical threat** (high intent, limited capacity)

---

## 🇮🇳 India-Specific Insights

- India ranks among the **top 5 military spenders globally**
- Defence budget has **more than doubled since 2014**
- Capital expenditure is increasing → modernization focus
- Defence R&D remains **below optimal levels (<5%)**
- Indigenous manufacturing and defence exports are rising

---

## 📌 Key Findings

- Global defence spending is structurally high
- Technology dominance outweighs troop strength
- China’s low GDP burden enables long-term expansion
- India’s strategy is balanced but needs stronger R&D focus
- Indigenous defence production is improving but not yet at scale
